    <h2>More On My Work</h2>
    <p>In addition to my wide range of interests and skills, I also have a passion for selling wholesale bulk Pokemon cards. I have thousands upon thousands of cards in stock, ready to be shipped to collectors and stores alike. I take pride in providing bulk high-quality cards at the cheapest price and excellent customer service to all of my clients.</p>
    <p>Alongside my intrest for music, I also create my own songs using FL Studio. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I enjoy exploring different genres and experimenting with different sounds. I find the creative process of making music to be both challenging and rewarding, and I love being able to share my creations with others.    </p>
    <p>Another one of my hobbies is game development, and I have found a lot of success on the popular platform Roblox. I enjoy scripting games and creating new experiences for players to enjoy. I have managed to get 22,000 visits on my profile at a young age of 13, which is a great start for the hard work and dedication that I put into my projects. I'm excited to see where my passion for coding and game development will take me in the future.</p>
